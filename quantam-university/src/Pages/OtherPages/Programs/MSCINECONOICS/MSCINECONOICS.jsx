          Course Registration System for a Semester
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          Course registration for each semester in the M.Sc. in Economics
          program at BUBT is done before the start of the semester. Students are
          required to register for the courses of the upcoming/next semester
          immediately after the result publication and before the start of the
          next semester.
        </p>

          Course Loads per Semester
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The normal course load for a student is a maximum of 12 credit hours
          per semester. However, if a student obtains a CGPA above 3.00 out of a
          4 CGPA scale, they may be allowed to take an extra course as a
          'Retake' or for 'Improvement' from the courses registered/studied in
          the previous semesters. Students with a CGPA below 3.00 are not
          allowed to register for more than 4 courses. It is not possible to
          take advance courses as extra load. If a student fails to take a
          course when it was offered or if the course is not offered in the
          current semester, they can take that course as SSM (Self Study Mode)
          after consulting with their instructor.

          Course and Credit Distribution over the Academic Years
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To obtain a master's degree in Economics, students must complete at
          least 39 credit hours, including core and elective courses. The M.Sc.
          in Economics program requires students to complete 8 core courses and
          4 elective courses (out of a total of 7 available electives), with
          each course carrying 3 credit hours. In the 4th (final) semester,
          students must complete a project work equivalent to 3 credit hours.
          The project work is supervised by a teacher, and at the final stage,
          the student must defend their work. The table below shows the
          structure of the courses in the M.Sc. program:
